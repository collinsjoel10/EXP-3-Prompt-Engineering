# EXP-3-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
Evaluation of 2024 Prompting Tools Across Diverse AI Platforms: 
ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
Select a common technical passage (e.g., a paragraph explaining machine learning).

Design a single prompt applied across all five platforms.

Collect and record the outputs from each tool.

Evaluate on three parameters:

Performance (Accuracy & Relevance)

User Experience (Ease of interaction, speed, formatting)

Response Quality (Clarity, completeness, creativity)

Summarize results in a comparative table.

## Prompt
"Summarize the following paragraph in 3 simple sentences suitable for a beginner in AI:
‘Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Applications of machine learning include spam filtering, speech recognition, and recommendation systems.’"

## Output

ChatGPT

Machine learning is a branch of AI that helps computers learn from data without being programmed step by step. It works by studying information, spotting patterns, and then using these to make predictions or decisions. As more data is provided, the system improves its accuracy and performance. Real-world uses include filtering spam in emails, recognizing human speech, and powering recommendation systems like YouTube or Amazon.

Claude

Machine learning is an AI technique that allows computers to improve automatically through experience. Instead of following rigid instructions, it learns by analyzing data and finding useful trends. These insights allow it to predict outcomes or classify new pieces of information. Examples include identifying spam messages, supporting speech recognition, and suggesting personalized products or content to users.

Bard

Machine learning gives computers the ability to study examples in data and then make predictions or decisions on their own. It reduces the need for manual programming because the system adapts as it processes new information. Over time, the accuracy increases, making the system smarter and more reliable. It is commonly used in email spam detection, apps that understand speech, and recommendation tools on streaming platforms.

Cohere Command

Machine learning is a central field of AI that helps systems learn patterns directly from data. It focuses on analyzing large datasets, identifying relationships, and using them to make reliable predictions. The more information provided, the more the model adapts and enhances its output. Popular applications include filtering unwanted emails, converting speech into text, and generating recommendations in e-commerce or entertainment services.

Meta (LLaMA)

Machine learning is an AI method where computers learn rules by examining data rather than receiving detailed programming. It works by recognizing patterns and applying them to make predictions or solve problems. As data grows, the system’s accuracy and decision-making skills improve significantly. Examples include spotting spam emails, recognizing voice commands, and providing personalized suggestions for movies, music, or online shopping.
